      Why do we use it?
      It is a long <a href="https://twitter.com/established">established</a> fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

  <h2>AfterCare</h2>
    <p class= "trendy">
    <img src="./image/Tattoo.jpg">
Tattoo after care is just as important as the putting it under the skin. Not caring for it will make it look faded super quick. Not to mention you go after the artist reputation and the work that they put out there! Good after care will make your ink look vibrant and alive for many years after the inital tattoo! </p>

  <h2>It Continues!</h2>
  <div id="four">
    <img src="image/artsty.jpg" alt="All Glory">

    <p>Having a tatoo is the physical representation of <a href="http://www.goenglish.com/WearYourHeartOnYourSleeve.asp">"Wearing your heart on you sleeves"</a>. You may have branded yourself for life, but hey its short so enjoy it! Enjoy, tell everyone your story and live large!</p>

  <h2>How to anger you parents!</h2>
  <div id="five">

    <p> A good tatoo can take quiet a while. Be prepared to take it. Artist would rather get thru it quick to put you thru the least amount of discomfort as possible.
    </p>
    <p>But good work takes time. Be prepared to lay like a corpse for mutliple hours!</p>
