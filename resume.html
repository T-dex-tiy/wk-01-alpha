              This is the worst part. The calm before the battle.

      Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets! In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms. But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. Fry! Stay back! He's too powerful!

      Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me. I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff!
      I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though!

      Who are you, my warranty?! You mean while I'm sleeping in it? And I'm his friend Jesus. Tell them I hate them.

          You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit!
          Pansy.
          Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say.

      Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker.

      I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love! Ask her how her day was. Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew.

          Can I use the gun?
          I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that.
          Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography.

      It's toe-tappingly tragic! Daddy Bender, we're hungry. Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer. Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo!

      There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors! And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you? You know, I was God once. Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually!

      Oh God, what have I done? No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! No, just a regular mistake. You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing. In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms.

      Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved. Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.

      And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it. Meh. What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid food. Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?!

      Hey, guess what you're accessories to. Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony? You know, I was God once. Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them.

      You wouldn't. Ask anyway! As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead. I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo. Guess again.

      Why did you bring us here? Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression! No, I'm Santa Claus! And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you?

      Say it in Russian! I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though! So, how 'bout them Knicks? Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk! I don't want to be rescued.

      Professor, make a woman out of me. If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right. Fatal. For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist! In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms.

      THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN! Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'? Leela's gonna kill me.
