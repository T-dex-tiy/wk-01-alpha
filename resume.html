      Why do we use it?
      It is a long <a href="https://twitter.com/established">established</a> fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

      Where can I get some?
      There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.

      <p>  I never loved you.

        When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults. When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film!

        Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"! I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in. Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal?

        I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day.

        Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped. You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried? And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you?

        Liz Jennings, Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians.
        Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file!
        Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me.
        Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious.

        Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy. That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"? Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very…

        I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died.
        No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires!
        Fatal.
        No. We're on the top. Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew. I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan! We don't have a brig. Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here.

        Kif, I have mated with a woman. Inform the men. It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels.

        That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing. Belligerent and numerous. Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'?

        Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away! Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long. Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them.

        Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments." Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them.

        You wouldn't. Ask anyway! For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored. Bender, you risked your life to save me! Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose.

      Bite my shiny metal ass. No, she'll probably make me do it. Moving along… Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk!

      Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped. Professor, make a woman out of me. Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood!

      Of all the friends I've had… you're the first. We don't have a brig. I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things. Who am I making this out to? They're like sex, except I'm having them!

      Then we'll go with that data file! Well, let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it. Large bet on myself in round one. Moving along… If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right.

      We're rescuing ya. Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. Really?! Do a flip! You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see!</p>
